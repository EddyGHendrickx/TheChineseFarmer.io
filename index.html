<strong>The story</strong>

<p>
   Once upon a time</p><p> there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.<br> They said, <q class="villager">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</q> <br>The farmer said, “<strong><q class="farmer">maybe</q></strong>.” The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,<br><q class="villager"> “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</q> The farmer again said, “<strong><q class="farmer">maybe</q></strong>.”

   The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.<br> The neighbors then said, <q class="villager">“Oh dear, that’s too <mark class="bad">bad</mark>,</q>” and the farmer responded, “<strong><q class="farmer">maybe</q></strong>.” The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villager"> “Isn’t that great!”</q> Again, he said, “<strong><q class="farmer">maybe</q></strong>.”

The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything <br>that happens in it is <mark class="good">good</mark> or <mark class="bad">bad</mark> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <mark class="good">good</mark> fortune.

Conclusion
<mark class="good">good</mark> and <mark class="bad">bad</mark> are just one perspective. Bananas are <mark class="good">good</mark> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <mark class="good">good</mark> for bananas. <br>Let's not make a big deal out of it...
